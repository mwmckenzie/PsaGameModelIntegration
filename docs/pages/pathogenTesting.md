# Pathogen Testing

## Why Is Determining A Testing Strategy Important?
- Testing should drive player-facing information generation
- Information about the disease will be learned through positive test results, including those obtained as a part of hospital admissions
- As such, I believe it is critical to map out the testing strategy and probabilistic testing rates for any 'reported' data fed to players of the game

## What Types of Testing Strategies Can Be Implemented or Tested?
- The testing rate can be static or variable over time, and can be responsive or predetermined
