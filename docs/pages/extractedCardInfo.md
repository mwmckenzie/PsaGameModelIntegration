## Card KC1

### Title
REPORT -HEALTHCARE

### Text

In the three affected cities, weekly pediatric hospital admissions for infection-related complications have increased over the last three weeks from 2 to 10 per 100K children under 12.

No hospitalizations over age 12 or deaths at any age have been attributed to the virus.

Clustering analysis of pathogen sequences indicates: 
- Potential high mortality rate in adults 
- Potential low transmission rate in all ages


## Card KC7

### Title

PROFILE – TESTING CAPACITY

### Text

National labs can run approximately 200 high accuracy test per day, with a 24-36 hour turn around. 

Home tests for influenza are widely available but may not detect H9N2 infections.
