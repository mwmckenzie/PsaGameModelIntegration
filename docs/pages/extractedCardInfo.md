### Title
REPORT -HEALTHCARE

### Text

In the three affected cities, weekly pediatric hospital admissions for infection-related complications have increased over the last three weeks from 2 to 10 per 100K children under 12.

No hospitalizations over age 12 or deaths at any age have been attributed to the virus.
