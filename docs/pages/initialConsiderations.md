# Player-Facing Information

## What are the possible dimensions of reliable player-facing information?

- Testing data
- Hospital data
- Survey data
- Research data

## Examples of each data dimension

### Testing data
- Number of tests given
- Number of positive results
- Number or ratio of positive results from hospital admissions

### Hospital data
- Number of hospital admissions confirmed to be from disease (slight reframing of above)
- Number of deaths (confirmed)

### Research data
- Increase in average/normal hospital admissions per period
- Increase in average/normal deaths per period

## Testing and player-facing information generation

- Information about the disease will be learned through positive test results
- Positive test results includes those captures in hospital admissions
- As such, I believe it is critical to map out the testing strategy and probabilistic testing rates for any 'reported' data fed to players of the game.
- The testing rate can be static or variable over time, and can be responsive or predetermined.
